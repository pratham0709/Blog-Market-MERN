### Comment Schema:

## Run

To run this application (the master branch), you have to set your own environmental variables in the server root folder. For security reasons, some variables have been hidden from view and used as environmental variables with the help of dotenv package. Below are the variables that you need to set in order to run the application:

- MONGO_URI: this is the connection string of your MongoDB Atlas database.

- SECRET_KEY: you can provide any string here, it is used to encrypt the JWT authentication token.

After you've set these environmental variables in the .env file at the root of the server folder, you need to navigate to the "seedDB" folder and run "node -r esm seedPosts.js" and "node -r esm seedUsers.js" to fill your empty MongoDB Atlas database.

Now that the database has data and the environmental variables are all set, you should run the two folders, the client and server together to run the application. Open two terminals, navigate to the client in one and to the server in another, run "npm start" in both terminals and the application should start.
